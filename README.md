Purpose:
This program uses polymorphism, inheritance, and abstract classes to resemble an easy-to-use
band. If users want to modify this to play their sounds, they must drop in files and 
rename that file path to the new path.

Requirements: 
Made in Java

Steps:

1. The user decides how many people they wish to add to the band (starts at 0)
2. Assigns an instrument and a name to each performer
3. The instruments include: piccolo, drums, vocalist, clarinet, and cymbals
4. The user then decides how many of those people added they wish to hear in the band
5. Then, they must pick people from the band list to add.
6. Once finished, they can choose to continue->remove/add people or quit
7. If quit was not chosen, then steps 1-6 are repeated

Remove for advancement: 
This program can be modified to add more sub-categories of instruments easily. 
More instruments can be added if the user desires 
Different sounds can also be added if the user desires.
